"""Problem 1 The dataset1 provides similarities, not distances. Write down three
    ways you could convert a similarity to a distance Ïˆij and choose one to use in the
    code. Briefly explain why you chose it over the others.
    1. Use the formula distance = (1 - similarity)
    2. Use the formula distance = 1 / similarity
    3.
    
    I will use distance = (1 - similarity) because it maintains the same scale as
    the similarity matrix and doesn't require normalizing. It is also easier for me
    to conceptualize in my head, if two categories have a similarity score of 1
    then their distance = 1 - 1 = 0 meaning they are in the same location. """
